I'm taking an _Intro to Programming_ class at Houston Community College as a pre-req for my CS Degree. I plan on eventually transferring to the University of Houston to complete my degree. 

I figured that taking notes as I read the textbook (can be found in pdf folder of this repo) and pushing the Markdown files to Github will help me archive my reflections and it may even be useful for others. I'll place exercises in the chapter folders that accompany it. 

Let's go.
