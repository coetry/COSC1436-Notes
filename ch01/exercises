1.)
  a.) False
  b.) False
  c.) True
  d.) False
  e.) False
  f.) False
  g.) False
  h.) True
  i.) True
  j.) False
  k.) False
  l.) False

2.) Arithmetic and Logical Operations

3.) CPU, Memory (RAM), I/O Devices

4.) To save data when the computer is turned off.
    When the computer is turned back on, it can
    be loaded off the secondary storage.

5.) An operating system manages the resources
    of the computer and provides services for
    the user and the programs that run on it

6.)

7.) Machine languages are written in binary
    and aren't always portable accross different
    machines, whereas high-level languages are
    expressed in a language closer to spoken
    language and can be portable accross different
    machines

8.) A source program is a text file expressed
    by the programmer in a high level-language.
    The source program adheres to the syntax
    rules defined by the high level-language.

9.) A compiler translates the high-level language
    to machine code that can be executed by the
    computer

10.) A compiler reports syntax errors

11.) A computer can only execute binary
     instructions defined by the chip. It
     cannot understand the syntax of higher-level
     languages.

12.) A high-level language allows the programmer
     to spend more time thinking about the actual
     problem instead of how the computer executes
     instructions.

13.) Linking is when external libraries are combined
     with the compiled object code.


14.) Problem analysis and algorithm design allows
     one to clearly understand a problem so it
     can be broken down into easy to follow steps.
     Those steps can be translated to a high-level
     program much quicker and maintaining it in the
     future will be easier as well.
